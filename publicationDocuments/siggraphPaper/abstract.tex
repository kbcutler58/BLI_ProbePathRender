For various medical applications, there is a need to track the location of probes as they move across a patient's body. Previous attempts at tracking objects as they move have used magnetic fields or a camera array. These options are impractical for our purposes. Additionally, the surface of a patient's body is deformable. In an attempt to rectify these problems, we developed a probe that produced displacement and orientation data as output. We then came up with an algorithm for taking all that data in real-time and producing a visualization of the path of the probe on the patient's body.
