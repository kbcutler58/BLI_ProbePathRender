Introduction
  - talk about the tracking system and the data I get from it

Related Work
  - talk about other tracking systems and their shortcomings
  - talk about mesh flattening papers
  - talk about papers on deformability

Coordinate Systems
  - the 4 coordinate systems we have
  - mouse sensor, probe, real world, virtual world
  - mention scale calibration
  - mention rotation calibration for flat surfaces

Mesh Following Algorithm
  - describe the mesh following algorithm
  - justify the mesh following algorithm
  - describe rotation calibration for deformable surfaces

Results
  - I will show the results for 4 of our models:
  - Cardboard Box, Phantom (flat surface examples)
  - Medicine Ball, Lola Model (deformable surface results)
  - Screenshots of the paths will be shown 
  - I will also take recorded paths between calibration points and compare the end points of the paths with the desired end points on the surface
  - The distance will be in virtual units. I will convert it to millimeters to show the error we end up getting at the moment

Conclusion & Future Work:
  - sum up everything accomplished with tracking
  - mention sources of error that could be improved:
     - hardware inaccuracies with tracking and 3D scanning
  - mention idea of modeling the deformation of the surface and using that to produce something more accurate
