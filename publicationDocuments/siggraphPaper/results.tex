\section{Experimental Results}

After applying the calibration algorithms to obtain solid calibration numbers, we ended up being able to track somewhat well. There were two serious limitations to improving the tracking further. The end points were not rigid and thus the original probe path did not end up in the spot that we would have wanted. Additionally, it was difficult to tell exactly where the probe was on the model so when specifying calibration points, there were measurement errors.
