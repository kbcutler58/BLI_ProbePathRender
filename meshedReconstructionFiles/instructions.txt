Here are the instructions for generating a mesh and texture from Chris's code:

1. Start the program

2. Reset the reconstruction

3. Click on Save Color Image

4. Click on Record Video and then move around the camera to make the mesh better

5. Click on Stop Recording when finished

6. Click on Create Mesh and make sure PLY is selected

7. Name it "MeshedReconstruction.ply" and put it in the following folder:
...\BLI Kinect Reconstruction\bin\Debug

8. In explorer, go to the following folder:
...\BLI Kinect Reconstruction\bin\Release

9. Find the PNG file corresponding to what was just recorded.
It should be "<number>.png". 

10. Take the number from step 9 and also find "<number>.txt"
as well as "<number>_depth_simple.png"

11. Take the three files from step 9,10 and copy them to:
...\BLI Kinect Reconstruction\bin\Debug

12. Go to the folder from step 11 and make sure there are no other
txt or png files in it besides the ones just copied

13. In that folder, double click on recon.bat and then follow 
the instructions

14. The files "textured_mesh.obj" and "textured_mesh.mtl"
will now contain the mesh and material for texture
